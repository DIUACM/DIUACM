## Database Schema

The forum uses the following database tables:
- `forum_categories` - Forum categories with color coding
- `forum_posts` - Forum posts with voting counts and metadata
- `forum_post_votes` - Individual user votes on posts
- `forum_comments` - Comments on posts (structure ready for future implementation)
- `forum_comment_votes` - Votes on comments (structure ready for future implementation)

## Components

### `ForumFilters`
- Handles search, sorting, and category filtering
- Manages URL query parameters for bookmarkable URLs
- Displays active filters with removal options

### `ForumPostCard`
- Displays individual forum posts in a card layout
- Handles voting functionality with optimistic updates
- Shows post metadata (author, category, comment count, timestamps)
- Reddit-inspired design with voting arrows on the left

### `CustomPagination`
- Reusable pagination component (shared with events page)
- Handles page navigation without full page reloads
- Displays page numbers with ellipsis for large page counts

## Server Actions

### `getForumPosts`
- Fetches paginated forum posts with filtering and sorting

## API Routes

The forum uses Next.js Server Actions instead of API routes for better performance and type safety.

## Future Enhancements

- Comment system with nested replies
- User reputation system
- Moderation tools
- Rich text editor for posts
- File attachments

1. Browse posts with pagination
2. Filter by category or search by title
3. Sort posts by different criteria
4. Vote on posts (requires authentication)
5. Click on posts to view details (future implementation)

The interface is fully responsive and works on all device sizes.
